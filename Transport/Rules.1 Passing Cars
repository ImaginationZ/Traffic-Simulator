(Limit1 < Limit2; Limit3 is setted appropriately.)

1.Drivers drive in the right-most lane.
2.When the distance between CAR1 and CAR2 is less than SafetyDistance:
		if Speed Difference < Limit1, CAR2 decelerates;
		if Limit1 < Speed Difference < Limit2, CAR2 moves to the one lane on the left, accelerates and passes CAR1;
		if Speed Difference > Limit2, CAR2 run into CAR1, an accident happens.
3.If the lane on the left has a CAR3, compare the speed of CAR2 and CAR3:
		if Speed Difference < Limit3, CAR2 decelerates;
		if Speed Difference > Limit3, CAR2 run into CAR3, an accident happens.
